# Rubric
## Project Workflow
Does not meet expectations. There is no evidence of a planning folder. The project does include a readme but I don't see any wireframes/sketches/erd's or user stories. I'm fairly certain you planned your project out but documenting the process is extremely helpful as a developer. Although thoroughly impressed by your project, I would love to recommend scoping a little bit smaller and planning out the pieces more effectively. Seems like you have a bunch of moving pieces with a lot of extensive functionality. Often times web apps are only have 1 or two pieces of core functionality but they do those things really well.

## Technical Requirements
Exceeds expectations. Really amazing job. You did a vanilla JS ajax call AND made API calls on the server. You also made a click event for those markers that you used for updating/creating bus stops, I thought that was pretty clever. You also use haml to boot! All these things are truly outside the scope of this class, so really great job. There was a whole bunch of functionality packed into just 4 days but as a result the final product wasn't very polished as the UI isn't very intuitive. I would strongly recommend linking up with a UX'er or designer and finishing this project for your portfolio, because it's got great functionality, UI just needs to be tweaked a bit.

## Code Quality
Meets expecatations. Code is properly indented. There are some pain points as I was parsing through the code to figure out the different moving pieces, I would STRONGLY encourage you to write comments for your code. The code that almost *requires* comments is your `wmata.rb` and your `application.js`. You're going to look at this code a month from now and really wish you had.

## Deployment and Functionality
Exceeds expectations. Application is deployed and functionality across the site looks great. One minor bug is having to refresh for your labels to not override the input boxes. Not sure what's causing that.

## Overall
Really amazing job as usual James. It's very evident you have a strong understanding of the materials covered and class thus far, and then some. For my final project in WDI I was extremely ambitious and picked a project that I was unable to finish. I don't think you did that to the severity in which I did. But I could tell that your code packed A LOT of different pieces of functionality. One recommendation that I would have is to fake the funk of an API call by making your own backend with exactly the information you want rather than relying on an external API. It's always tricky finding that 3rd party dependency that exactly fits your needs. It's never tricky to build out your own solution, though it may take more time. I guess that's why developers get paid pretty decent money.
